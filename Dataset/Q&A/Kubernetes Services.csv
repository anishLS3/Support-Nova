Question,Answer (Detailed Solution)
What if I don't know which Kubernetes platform (AKS, EKS, GKE) to choose?,"No problem. STAR provides expert consulting to evaluate your existing cloud infrastructure, business goals, and region of operation. Based on this analysis, we help you choose between AKS (for Azure users), EKS (for AWS), or GKE (for Google Cloud), ensuring seamless integration and cost efficiency."
Is Kubernetes too complex for my small team to manage?,"Kubernetes can be complex, but with STAR’s Kubernetes as a Service (KaaS), we simplify the entire process. We handle automation, scaling, monitoring, and upgrades for you, so your team can focus on development rather than infrastructure management."
Can Kubernetes integrate with my current CI/CD pipeline?,"Absolutely. Kubernetes is designed to work with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions. We ensure seamless integration without changing your workflow, so you can automate deployments effortlessly."
Will Kubernetes help me scale during high traffic?,"Yes. Kubernetes offers autoscaling based on load and metrics like CPU and memory. STAR configures your clusters to automatically adjust the number of pods and nodes, ensuring high performance during peak times and cost savings during low traffic."
How secure is my application in Kubernetes?,"Kubernetes provides multiple layers of security such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Secrets Management, and network policies. STAR enhances this with container image scanning, audit logs, and secure ingress/egress configurations."
Do I need to worry about updating Kubernetes clusters?,"Not at all. STAR enables auto-upgrades for your Kubernetes clusters to ensure you always benefit from the latest features and security patches — all without disrupting your live environment."
Can I run Kubernetes across multiple cloud providers?,"Yes. STAR helps set up and manage hybrid and multicloud Kubernetes clusters. We ensure consistent deployments, high availability, and unified monitoring whether you're using AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or on-premise data centers."
What if I'm already using Docker — do I still need Kubernetes?,"While Docker helps package applications, Kubernetes handles orchestration, scaling, and failover. If you're using Docker EE, STAR can help you run both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, depending on your app's complexity and needs."
Is it possible to migrate my current applications to Kubernetes?,"Yes. STAR audits your current apps, containerizes them (if needed), and migrates them into Kubernetes clusters without changing your environment. We maintain app availability and consistency throughout the migration."
Can you train my team to manage Kubernetes in-house?,"Definitely. STAR offers Kubernetes Consulting Services including training workshops, documentation, and one-on-one support. We empower your team to become self-sufficient while offering backup support when needed."
