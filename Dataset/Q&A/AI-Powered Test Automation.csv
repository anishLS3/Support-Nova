Question,Answer (Detailed Solution)
Can I automate testing for both Android and iOS apps with STAR’s solution?,"Yes, STAR’s AI-powered test automation supports both Android and iOS platforms. You can create and execute tests for native, hybrid, or web-based apps using Appium or TestProject interfaces directly from your IDE."
Is there a way to run multiple test projects at the same time?,"Absolutely. Our parallel test execution feature allows you to schedule and run multiple CI/CD projects simultaneously across different devices, reducing overall testing time significantly."
What’s the advantage of using AI in regression testing?,"AI enhances regression testing by intelligently identifying the most impacted test cases, reducing unnecessary re-runs. This speeds up test cycles, cuts down costs, and ensures your software remains stable after changes."
How does your platform handle different network conditions for mobile testing?,"Manual and automated tests on our platform simulate different network environments (WiFi, 3G, 4G, slow connections) to assess app behavior. This ensures your app performs well in real-world usage scenarios."
Do I need coding experience to create automation tests?,"No. With our visual test recorder and device reflection features, you can create and execute tests without writing any code. It’s ideal for both QA testers and developers who prefer GUI-based automation."
Can I run Selenium tests directly on your platform?,"Yes. You can execute Selenium-based test scripts on any browser or OS combination using STAR’s test automation platform. It simplifies Selenium setup, reduces flakiness, and allows easy CI/CD integration."
How can we test apps on multiple devices located in the cloud?,"We provide access to real devices hosted in public cloud labs. You can automate and run tests across various device models, OS versions, and screen sizes—all remotely and simultaneously."
Is it possible to integrate your testing system into our CI/CD pipeline?,"Yes. Our platform seamlessly integrates with Jenkins, GitLab, Bitbucket, and other DevOps tools. This enables fully automated test runs during your deployment process."
What if we want to manually test specific features after automation?,"STAR supports a hybrid approach. While most routine tests are automated, manual testing is still available for edge cases, UI disruptions, hardware events, or unpredictable user interactions."
How do you ensure test coverage for responsive web apps?,"Our web testing tools support multiple screen sizes, devices, and frameworks (e.g., Angular, React). Automated scripts are executed in parallel across different viewport sizes to verify responsive behavior effectively."
